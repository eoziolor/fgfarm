Copied the vcf called on fhet genome from fgran individuals from the kodiak cluster (with the .tbi index file)
created a git repo

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

after working the normal workflow on admixture added the line:

cat all_scaf.bim | awk '{gsub("\\.1","");print}'

got rid of the .1 at the end of the scaffold names in het

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

downloaded GATK-version 3.3 because picard has some issue recognizing variants with the reference.

Gave up on liftover and am mapping things in the fget repo to the chromosome

Admixture timed out on k7, so currently re-running just that

Used the following script to create chr10 file

paste \
<(cat chrompos.txt | cut -f 1,3) \
<(zcat hetgrand.hap.vcf.gz | grep -v ^# ) | \
grep "^chr10" | \
sort -k 2,2n | \
gzip >chr10.txt.gz


header of hetgrand.vcf.gz will have two less fields because it doesn't have chromosome positoin, remove scaffolds from the chr10

paste \
<(zcat chr10.txt.gz | cut -f 1-2,5-576) \
<(cat header.txt) \
<(zcat head.vcf.gz | grep "##" |\
bgzip > chr10.vcf.bgz


repeat for chromosome 1 that you fucked up!

tabix -p vcf chr10.vcf.bgz
